[2023-01-03 18:04:49.307] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2023-01-03 18:04:58.402] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
[2023-01-03 18:04:58.421] (FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (29.94429551955829, 31.470751940253827) at itr = 1
[2023-01-03 18:04:58.431] Inner CCGA forloop terminated due to a positive lower of bound of: 29.94429551955829 from FSP which is higher than: Ïµ=10.0.
