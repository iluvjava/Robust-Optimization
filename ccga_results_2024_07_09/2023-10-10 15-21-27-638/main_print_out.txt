[2023-10-10 15:21:30.661] Outter Forloop itr=1
[2023-10-10 15:21:32.616] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2023-10-10 17:21:33.03] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
[2023-10-10 17:21:33.137] (FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (46.68316831683168, 49.654208095249906) at itr = 1
[2023-10-10 17:21:33.153] Inner CCGA forloop terminated due to a positive lower of bound of: 46.68316831683168 from FSP which is higher than: Ïµ=1.0.
[2023-10-10 17:21:33.154] Introduced cut to the msp and we are solving it.
