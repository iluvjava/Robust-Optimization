[2024-06-24 18:08:47.811] Outter Forloop itr=1
[2024-06-24 18:08:50.674] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2024-06-25 04:08:38.63] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
[2024-06-25 04:08:38.783] (FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (85.0, 135.00110084121116) at itr = 1
[2024-06-25 04:08:38.797] Inner CCGA forloop terminated due to a positive lower of bound of: 85.0 from FSP which is higher than: Ïµ=0.1.
[2024-06-25 04:08:38.806] Introduced cut to the msp and we are solving it.
