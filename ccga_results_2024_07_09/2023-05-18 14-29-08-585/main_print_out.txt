[2023-05-18 14:29:10.276] Outter Forloop itr=1
[2023-05-18 14:29:10.655] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2023-05-18 14:59:10.243] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
[2023-05-18 14:59:10.302] (FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (117.07692307692307, 124.76995668603558) at itr = 1
[2023-05-18 14:59:10.303] Inner CCGA forloop terminated due to a positive lower of bound of: 117.07692307692307 from FSP which is higher than: Ïµ=1.0.
[2023-05-18 14:59:10.304] Introduced cut to the msp and we are solving it.
