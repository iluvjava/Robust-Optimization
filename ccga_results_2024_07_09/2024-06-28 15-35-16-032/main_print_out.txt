[2024-06-28 15:35:18.69] Outter Forloop itr=1
[2024-06-28 15:35:20.688] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2024-06-29 01:35:21.301] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
[2024-06-29 01:35:21.462] (FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (123.33333333333334, 156.6666678147924) at itr = 1
[2024-06-29 01:35:21.488] Inner CCGA forloop terminated due to a positive lower of bound of: 123.33333333333334 from FSP which is higher than: Ïµ=0.1.
[2024-06-29 01:35:21.499] Introduced cut to the msp and we are solving it.
