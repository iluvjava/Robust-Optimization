### **Variables and Their Info**

* $q,w$ are binary decision variables for the secondary and primary decision variables for the Generator System.

### **MP: The main Problem**

The main problem doesn't have any specific objectives, and it's flexible to define what its objective is, it's also flexible for whatever additional constraints it posses. But whatever we are doing with it, we consider it to at least possess the following constraints for the system: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & Bw + Gq + Gu + Hd \le h
    \\
    & \hat{d} - \gamma \mathbf 1 \le d \le \hat d + \gamma \mathbf 1
\end{aligned}
$$
