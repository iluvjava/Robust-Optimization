[2022-09-03 16:23:48.1] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2022-09-03 16:23:50.782] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
(FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (0.0, -0.0) at itr = 1
[2022-09-03 16:23:50.984] CCGA Inner loop continues, constraints is introduced to fmp and we are solving it. 
Inner CCGA forloop termminated due to convergence of FSP and FMP on tolerance level Ïµ=0.1, new fmp returns: -0.0
Outer for loop terminated due to convergence of FMP, FSP to an objective value of zero.
