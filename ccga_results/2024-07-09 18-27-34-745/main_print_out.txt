[2024-07-09 18:27:50.189] Outter Forloop itr=1
[2024-07-09 18:27:53.223] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2024-07-10 04:27:38.777] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
[2024-07-10 04:27:38.925] (FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (64.28571428571428, 90.00002647102178) at itr = 1
[2024-07-10 04:27:38.94] Inner CCGA forloop terminated due to a positive lower of bound of: 64.28571428571428 from FSP which is higher than: Ïµ=0.1.
[2024-07-10 04:27:38.949] Introduced cut to the msp and we are solving it.
