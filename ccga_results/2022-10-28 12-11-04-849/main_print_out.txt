Outter Forloop itr=1
[2022-10-28 12:11:20.772] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2022-10-28 12:11:21.129] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
(FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (778.771465871111, 818.9995330888888) at itr = 1
Inner CCGA forloop terminated due to a positive lower of bound of: 778.771465871111 from FSP which is higher than: ϵ=0.1.
[2022-10-28 12:11:28.798] Introduced cut to the msp and we are solving it. 
Objective value of msp settled at: 2.0833333333333335. 
Outter Forloop itr=2
[2022-10-28 12:11:28.965] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2022-10-28 12:11:29.451] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
(FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (0.0, -0.0) at itr = 1
[2022-10-28 12:11:29.504] CCGA Inner loop continues, constraints is introduced to fmp and we are solving it. 
Inner CCGA forloop termminated due to convergence of FSP and FMP on tolerance level ϵ=0.1, new fmp returns: -0.0
Outer for loop terminated due to convergence of FMP, FSP to an objective value of zero.
