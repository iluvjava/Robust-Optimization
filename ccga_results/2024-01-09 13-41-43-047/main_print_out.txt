[2024-01-09 13:41:45.789] Outter Forloop itr=1
[2024-01-09 13:41:47.74] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2024-01-09 15:41:48.736] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
[2024-01-09 15:41:48.845] (FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (117.07692307692308, 124.77040187304975) at itr = 1
[2024-01-09 15:41:48.876] Inner CCGA forloop terminated due to a positive lower of bound of: 117.07692307692308 from FSP which is higher than: Ïµ=1.0.
[2024-01-09 15:41:48.885] Introduced cut to the msp and we are solving it.
