[2023-11-06 12:35:55.614] Outter Forloop itr=1
[2023-11-06 12:35:57.638] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2023-11-06 14:35:57.795] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
[2023-11-06 14:35:57.889] (FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (46.68316831683168, 49.654208095249906) at itr = 1
[2023-11-06 14:35:57.905] Inner CCGA forloop terminated due to a positive lower of bound of: 46.68316831683168 from FSP which is higher than: Ïµ=1.0.
[2023-11-06 14:35:57.907] Introduced cut to the msp and we are solving it.
