[2022-10-02 22:01:52.999] Inner loop is initialized with fmp, and we are solving the initial fmp. 
[2022-10-02 22:01:53.249] FSP is made and we are solving it. 
(FSP Lower, FMP Upper) = (778.771465871111, 818.9995330888888) at itr = 1
Inner CCGA forloop terminated due to a positive lower of bound of: 778.771465871111 from FSP which is higher than: Ïµ=0.1.
[2022-10-02 22:02:02.353] Introduced cut to the msp and we are solving it. 
Objective value of msp settled at: 2.0833333333333335.
